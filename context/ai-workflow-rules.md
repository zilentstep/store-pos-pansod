# AI Workflow Rules

## Approach

Build this project incrementally using a spec-driven workflow. Context files define what to build, how to build it, and the current state of progress. Always implement against these specs — do not infer or invent behavior from scratch.

## Scoping Rules

- Work on one feature unit at a time
- Prefer small, verifiable increments over large speculative changes
- Do not combine unrelated system boundaries in a single implementation step

## When to Split Work

Split an implementation step if it combines:

- Frontend UI changes AND backend API changes (do API first, then UI, or vice versa)
- Multiple unrelated API routes (do one resource at a time)
- Behavior not clearly defined in the context files

If a change cannot be verified end to end quickly, the scope is too broad — split it.

## Handling Missing Requirements

- Do not invent product behavior not defined in the context files
- If a requirement is ambiguous, resolve it in the relevant context file before implementing
- If a requirement is missing, add it as an open question in `progress-tracker.md` before continuing

## Protected Files

Do not modify the following unless explicitly instructed:

- `context/*` — Project specification files (these define what to build)
- `wrangler.toml` — Deployment configuration (ask before changing)

## Keeping Docs in Sync

Update the relevant context file whenever implementation changes:

- System architecture or boundaries
- Storage model decisions (new tables/columns)
- Code conventions or standards
- Feature scope changes

## Before Moving to the Next Unit

1. The current unit works end to end within its defined scope
2. No invariant defined in `architecture.md` was violated
3. `progress-tracker.md` reflects the completed work
4. `npm run build` passes (or verification command passes)
5. The user has been asked to review and approve the phase
